`servings: 16 medium cookies or 8 large cookies`  
`prep time: 15 minutes (active) + 8-9 hours chilling`  
`cook time: 25-35 minutes`  
`total time: ~9 hours (including chilling)`  

`ingredients`  
`wet`  
- 2 large eggs  
- 1 cup (226g) melted butter  
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup (200g) brown sugar (cane/coconut sugar)  
- 1/3 cup (67g) granulated brown sugar  

`dry`  
- 2 cups (240g) all-purpose flour  
- 1 teaspoon baking soda  
- 3/4 teaspoon salt  

`mix-ins`  
- 1 1/3 cups total of chocolate and nuts (choose from white chocolate, plain chocolate, or almonds)  
- set aside a small portion to top the cookies before baking  

`to do`
step 1: dissolve sugar in wet ingredients  
1. in a large bowl, whisk together **melted butter, brown sugar, granulated brown sugar, and eggs** until the sugar fully dissolves. the mixture should look glossy and slightly slimy
2. cover and **chill overnight** (or at least 8 hours)

step 2: prepare dry ingredients  
1. in a separate bowl, whisk together **flour, baking soda, and salt** until evenly combined

step 3: combine and chill again  
2. remove the wet mixture from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes if too firm.  
3. slowly mix in the dry ingredients until just combined. do not overmix.  
4. fold in the chocolate and nuts, leaving some aside for topping.  
5. cover and **chill again for 30 minutes to 1 hour** (optional, but helps with texture).  

step 4: shape and bake  
6. preheat oven to **175°c (350°f)**. line a baking sheet with parchment paper

7. scoop dough into balls:  
   - **medium cookies:** use 2 tablespoons of dough per cookie (~16 cookies total)
   - **large cookies:** use 4 tablespoons (¼ cup) per cookie (~8 cookies total) and flatten slightly with the back of a spoon
8. place the cookie dough balls on the tray and press the reserved chocolate/nuts on top

9. **bake:**  
   - **medium cookies:** 25-30 minutes, until edges are golden but centers are soft
   - **large cookies:** 35 minutes after flattening
10. let cookies cool on the tray for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.  

`notes`  
- **for extra chewiness:** chill the dough for up to 24 hours
- **for a softer center:** reduce baking time by 2-3 minutes and let cookies cool on the tray
- **for a crispier edge:** use a mix of white and brown sugar instead of all brown 
- **for deeper caramel flavor:** use dark brown sugar instead of light brown
- **for more chocolate flavor:** use a mix of white, milk, and dark chocolate
