`step 1: dissolve sugar in wet ingredients  `
1. in a large bowl, whisk together **melted butter, brown sugar, granulated brown sugar and eggs** until the sugar fully dissolves. the mixture should look glossy and slightly slimy
2. cover and chill overnight (or at least 8 hours)

`step 2: prepare dry ingredients  `
1. in a separate bowl, whisk together **flour, baking soda and salt** until evenly combined

`step 3: combine and chill again  `
1. remove the wet mixture from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes if too firm
2. slowly mix in the dry ingredients with peanut butter until just combined. do not over mix
3. fold in the chocolate and nuts, leaving some aside for topping
4. cover and chill again for 30 mins (optional, but helps with texture)

`step 4: shape and bake  `
1. preheat oven to **175°c (350°f)**. line a baking sheet with parchment paper. keep the tray in the oven

2. scoop dough into balls:  
   - **medium cookies:** use 1 1/5 tablespoons of dough per cookie
   - **large cookies:** use 2 tablespoons  per cookie and flatten slightly with the back of a spoon
3. place the cookie dough balls on the tray and press the reserved chocolate/nuts on top

4. bake:
   - **medium cookies:** 10-12 minutes, until edges are golden but centres are soft
   - **large cookies:** 15 minutes after flattening
5. let cookies cool on the tray for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack

`notes`  
- **extra chewiness:** chill the dough for up to 24 hours. also helps with keeping shape
- **softer centre:** reduce baking time by 2-3 minutes and let cookies cool on the tray
- **crispier crust:** mix of white and brown sugar instead of all brown. add semolina to the flour mix
- **deeper caramel flavour:** dark brown sugar instead of light brown
- **more variety:** mix of white, milk and dark chocolate
- **nuttier (?) flavour:** use [brown butter](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5ZsHgdi-V_c)
- keep large gaps between each cookie as they tend to flatten out significantly

`my personal favourites`
- peanut butter + chocolate
- white chocolate + almonds + brown butter
